# Startpage

![](preview.png)

This project was forked from [EmDev21/TerminalStartpage](https://github.com/EmDev21/TerminalStartpage) for the purposes of tailoring its' features specifically to me.

## Features
* Site-specific search prefixes
* Hardcoded bookmark filtering
* Not much else...

Check the page source for a rundown of how things work, there's a [live preview hosted](https://breadcat.github.io/startpage/) on Github Pages.
